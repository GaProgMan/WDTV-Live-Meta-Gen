Purpose of the project:		I had recently purchased a WDTV Live
				(hereafter refered to as "The Magic Box"), and
				was having problems with metadata generation for
				my media files. So, I looked up the format used
				for the metadata (XML) and half wrote a small
				C# app to generate the correct metadata files for
				a given TV Series or Film.
							Currently, the TV Series part of the
				app is the only section that has been written. It
				uses hard coded values for finding banner images
				and data. These hard coded values point to the web-
				resource TheTVDB (http://www.thetvdb.com).
							Shortly after starting development of
				this app, I was informed that the name format that
				I was using was incorrect. The correct name format
				is: <ShowName>.<SeasonNumber><EpisodeNumber>.<ext>
							Thus, this app has not been developed
				any further.
							To compile this app, you will need to
				have access to Visual Studio 2008 (or greater) and
				the .NET 3 (or higher) framework.
